# Thruster Maintenance #

## Description ##
This page describes the process of lubricating the Seabotix BTD 150 thrusters that Seabee III uses.  This process is recommended after every 50 hours of use.  The lubricant can be purchased directly from Seabotix  (Item No. GLA003). (Should take approx. 5 min/thruster)

## Procedure ##
  1. Remove thrusters from frame (if needed).
  1. Remove nozzle by unscrewing the three phillip screws surrounding nozzle.
  1. On top of the propeller-side end cap, there is a seal screw.  Unscrew this screw.
  1. Squirt the lubricant into the grease gallery (this is where the seal screw originally was).
  1. Old lubricant should leak out (in a stringy form) of the other side of the same endcap.
  1. Continue to squirt lubricant in until lubricant leaking out is clean.
  1. That's it!  Wipe away the excess grease and reassemble the parts.
  1. Repeat for all thrusters.
