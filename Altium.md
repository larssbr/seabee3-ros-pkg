<h2>Creating Altium Logos</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Today, we can learn how to create our own logo for the top layer of our project in Altium. This is done pretty simply because Altium was kind enough to provide us with a variety of scripts. You can download them <a href='http://valhalla.altium.com/AD10-Examples/Examples/Scripts.zip'>here.</a>


<h3>Details</h3>

<ul><li>Find the folder inside Scripts entitled <b>Delphiscript Scripts</b>. Open the <b>PCB folder</b> inside and find the <b>PCB Logo Creator</b> file. You will find several Altium test images there, as well as the Altium Script Project <b>PCBLogoCreator</b>. Click on it to open it in Altium.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Convert your image to a <b>BMP image</b> if it isn't already. This can be done in Paint.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Once you have the script opened up in Altium, you can run the <code>LayerComboBox.pas</code> and select your image. Hit convert, and it should bring up your desired image in the Altium main screen top layer. You can use the Altium logo test images to determine an ideal resolution for your own picture.<br>
