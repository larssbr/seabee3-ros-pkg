# Introduction #

Given a known object and it's size, this library interpolates from 2D space to 3D space. It accomplishes this by first viewing a known object with known size vs. pixel width at a known distance from the camera, and then saves this calibration. Later, given a different observed pixel width of a known object, this will extrapolate the distance to the object.

# Usage #
