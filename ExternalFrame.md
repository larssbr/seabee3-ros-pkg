# Introduction #

Using ¼” thick T6061 anodized aluminum, the mechanical team created a lightweight, hydrodynamic frame that could support the weight of the hull. The frame measures 24” x 12.5” x 16.5”. There are two mount bars on top and four on the bottom for competition specific components. The side rails, can be used to mount our flotation system. We wanted to make the external frame flexible for future modular upgrades, so we placed auxiliary ports on the end cap.
