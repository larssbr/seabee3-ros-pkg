# Technical Info #

The mechanical design of SeaBee III stems from a desire to make the teamâ€™s AUV more compact and lightweight. The single-hull design with an internal rack system was developed to enable easy removal and access to electronics. In addition, connections are established by using waterproof connectors from the end cap to external components such as the compass, SONAR, marker droppers, cameras, thrusters and the bump sensor.
