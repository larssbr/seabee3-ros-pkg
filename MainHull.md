# Introduction #

The hull for Seabee III is constructed out of 3/16” thick T6061 anodized aluminum. The enclosure employs a cylindrical design measuring 7.5” in diameter and 13” in length. It shields the internal electrical systems from water damage with a watertight design. In the hull cap design, the mechanical team members covered the cap with waterproof Fischer Connectors allowing access to the electrical systems from components outside of the hull.
