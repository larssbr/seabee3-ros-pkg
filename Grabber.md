# Introduction #
The grabber project consists of capturing an object made of PVC pipe and then releasing the object upon surfacing. The object may be made of a single PVC pipe or a configuration of pipes of variable diameter. Assuming the least about the object, and thus making the grabber as robust as possible, will be the key design feature for this project this year.

# Past Objective Information #
## 2011 Competition ##
**Vase Capture (PVC recovery)** - This task consists of capturing a 3" x 3ft (7.63cm x 0.91m) PVC "Vase" held in a fixture. This fixture will constrain the "Vase" from movement and rotation in such a way that you have to lift it up from the fixture to remove it. The "Vase" will be colored orange using Duck Tape. The Vase will be laying on it's side, so from above, you will see an ~3in x 3ft (7.63cm x 0.91m) area. The weight of the vase will be adjusted so that it is slightly negatively buoyant.

A capture consists of constraining the object in at least 3 degrees of freedom (grabbing the object with a dangling line does not count). In order to obtain full points for the drop off, once the vehicle has surfaced, the "Vase" must be released from the vehicle and sink back down. No part of the object can be hung up on the vehicle.

### Scoring ###
| **Task** | **Max Points** |
|:---------|:---------------|
| Surface with the Vase | 1200           |
| Transport Vase to second Octagon | 800            |
| Drop the Vase | 500            |

## 2010 Competition ##
**Counselor Capture (PVC recovery)** - This task consists of capturing a PVC "Counselor" held in a fixture. This fixture will constrain the "Counselor" from movement and rotation in such a way that you have to lift it up from the fixture to remove it. The "Counselor" will be painted orange. The Counselor will be positioned such that, from the top, you will see the largest dimensions: 2 x 2 ft (0.61m x 0.61m ). It will also be made from 1/2" PVC pipe.

A capture consists of constraining the object in at least 3 degrees of freedom (grabbing the object with a dangling line does not count). In order to obtain full points for the drop off, once the vehicle has surfaced, the "Counselor" must be released from the vehicle and sink back down. No part of the object can be hung up on the vehicle.

### Scoring ###
| **Task** | **Max Points** |
|:---------|:---------------|
| Surface with the Counselor | 1000           |
| Drop the Counselor | 500            |
