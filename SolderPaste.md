We use solder paste as part of our process for populating circuit boards used on Seabee. Here's what Sparkfun has to say about solder paste:

> Solder paste is a sticky grey substance that is somewhat liquid - well that's a paste now isn't it... Pretty much lead and tin mixed together with flux and some other magic ingredients. We use Easy 256 from Kester. Why? It's a No-Clean paste which means after you are done reflowing the board, you're done! No need to wash the board. Any solder paste will do.

> One of the main problems is getting the paste. A 500g jar can cost from $50-$200 which is bad enough. The company you purchase it from will most likely charge you an arm and a leg for overnight shipping, cold packaging, and hazardous handling. Yep, lead is considered hazardous. Who knew? To top things off, I mentioned this "lead being hazardous" thing to my sister who works as an Emergency Room Nurse. She pointed out that there are no symptoms of lead poisoning - short of dementia. One has to be specifically blood tested for higher levels of lead. So I'm not sure if this means we're ok, or if we are actually poisoned and the preposterous nature of these tutorials are proof...

> The solder paste suppliers insist on shipping cold packed overnight delivery because the solder paste can become 'unusable' if it's temperature is not closely maintained. Of course we didn't find this to be the case - but then again, we're not producing 10,000 units of a board. Just imagine if you screened and placed $40,000 worth of parts and PCBs only to find out the paste had gone bad. The batch might be lost. Who are you going to sue? Now you know why suppliers are so uptight, but we don't have to be...

> We did notice that the paste will change over time without refrigeration. A syringe or tube of paste should be okay in an air tight container, in a cool place (basement), for multiple weeks. Buy your supply accordingly. It may make sense to buy a mini-fridge like we did from Tar-chet. $60 goes quite a ways these days.
