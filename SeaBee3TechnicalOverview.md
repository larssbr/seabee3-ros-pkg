# Technical Overview #
  * SeaBee3 is an autonomous underwater vehicle assembled by members of the USC underwater robotics team. Its six thrusters allow it to move smoothly and quickly through the water while translating in three dimensions and rotating in two. The robot runs ROS and Ubuntu 9.10 x86 on a Core2 Duo computer and utilizes two Propeller chips to read sensors and manage low-level electronic components. The motherboard and power board are both custom-designed by team members.
