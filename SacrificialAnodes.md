# Introduction #
For a robots like Seabee, where the majority for the mechanical implementation is made of metal (aluminum, in our case), corrosion is a serious concern. Corrosion can be mitigated through the use of a sacrificial anode. We determine the electrochemical potential of the hull and frame and attach a chunk of metal with a lower electrochemical potential. This effectively turns the hull into a battery, with the new metal chunk acting as the anode. The anode will corrode away before the hull can begin to corrode, hence the description "sacrifical".

### Navalloy ###
Navalloy is an aluminum/zinc/indium alloy with an electrochemical potential slightly lower than that of pure zinc. It offers slightly better galvanic protection and has 1/3 the weight of zinc.
Navalloy anodes are available at go2marine.com. These anodes have embedded indicator materials that become visible when the anode must replaced.
