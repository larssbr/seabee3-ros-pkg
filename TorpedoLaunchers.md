# Introduction #

The AUV must be able to fire markers in the surge and heave axes in order to complete two of the competition manipulation challenges.


# Marker Construction #


We will prototype the markers using the iLab's Makerbot and cast copies using a process similar to the one shown in this video: http://youtu.be/i-HXU4cfvdc. Molds will be made using [Oomoo 30 silicon rubber](http://www.amazon.com/Smooth-On-Oomoo-30-Silicone-2-8/dp/B001PNE1YM). They will be cast using [Smooth-cast 300 polyurethane resin](http://www.amazon.com/Smooth-On-Smooth-Cast-Liquid-Plastic-Compound/dp/B004BN7G0E/).

Associated things to buy:
  * Mixing cups
  * Tongue depressors
  * Mold-release
  * Material to build mold walls (legos??)
  * Dye for making fancy-colored markers
