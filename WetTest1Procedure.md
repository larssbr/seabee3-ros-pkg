# Software, General #
  1. Connect ethernet tether
  1. Insert batteries; power on sub
  1. Check ethernet connectivity
  1. Log in
  1. Run [diagnostic script](http://robotics.usc.edu/~ekaszubski/projects/seabee3/test_core_components.bash)
  1. Put sub in water
  1. Repeat step 5 in the water
  1. Refine flotation while camera brightness is tuned
  1. Test basic controls performance (5-10 mins) while distance measuring tool is being deployed
  1. Set optimal depth for data collection
  1. Repeat step 5 at depth
  1. Initiate dynamics data collection procedure (45 mins or so, will provide more detailed procedure for this step)
  1. Terminate data collection
  1. Any other steps which require control of the vehicle
  1. Remove vehicle from water

# Dynamics Data Collection #
## Short ##
  * For each run:
    1. Align sub's intended translational axis with tape
    1. Initiate run at 50% thrust
  1. Positive X-axis
  1. Negative X-axis
  1. Positive Y-axis
  1. Negative Y-axis

## Normal ##
  * For each run:
    1. Align sub's intended translational axis with tape
    1. Initiate run at 50% thrust
    1. Repeat run at 100% thrust
  1. Positive X-axis
  1. Negative X-axis
  1. Positive Y-axis
  1. Negative Y-axis

## Extended ##
  * For each run:
    1. Align sub's intended translational axis with tape
    1. Initiate run at 25% thrust
    1. Repeat run at 50% thrust
    1. Repeat run at 75% thrust
    1. Repeat run at 100% thrust
  1. Positive X-axis
