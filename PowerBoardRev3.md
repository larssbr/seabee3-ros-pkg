# Introduction #

The current power board is being revised to accommodate a new microcontroller, additional motor drivers, a revised method of voltage regulation, and an increasedly modular and versatile design. We want to be able to make changes in the future without having to redesign the entire board. We are currently still deciding between keeping the size of the board the same as it was before or separating it into multiple, stackable boards.
