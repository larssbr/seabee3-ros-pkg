# Reson TC 4013 #

The planned final system will use 4 Reson TC 4013 miniature reference hydrophones. We chose this model due to its high sensitivity, omnidirectional pickup pattern, flat frequency response, and small size.

## Datasheet ##

The product page for the hydrophones can be found [here](http://www.reson.com/products/hydrophones/tc-4013/), and you can view the datasheet [here](http://www.reson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/TC4013.pdf).

## Hydrophone Dimensions ##
  * nitrile rubber pickup case
    * 25mm long x 9mm diameter
  * rubber O-ring
    * 8.2mm diameter x 1.5mm thick
  * stainless steel body
    * 7mm diameter x 25mm long
  * Strain releif
    * tapering from 7.6mm diameter x 13mm long

**To properly mount hydrophones in watertight case, we drilled a hole using a 17/64" drill bit and sanded the rest until fit was perfect.**

## Cable and plug ##
The coaxial cable terminates in a coaxial plug. Past attempts used BNC and SMA connectors, but both proved to be too large. To effectively mount and de-mount the hydrophones, the plug must be smaller in diameter than the hydrophone casing itself so the plug can be removed without being cut (again). We have decided on using Lemo FFA.00.250.NTAC 22z plugs, the ones that came with the hydrophones originally. BNC adaptors for the Lemo plugs are easy to attach for testing with oscilloscopes.
