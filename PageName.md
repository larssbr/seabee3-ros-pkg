# Cooling System #
Currently plan on using a liquid cooling system to dissipate the heat generated by the ADL, keeping it under design temperatures even when operating vehicle fully enclosed in air.

## Radiator ##
_Coolgate Dual 120mm Radiator_

  * **Mass** - 1.3 kg
  * **Dimensions** - 291.6 x 124 x 60 mm
  * **Effective Surface Area**  - ~ 0.8 m<sup>2</sup>
    * We require at least 0.5 m<sup>2</sup> of surface area under normal stagnant air conditions to dissipate 45 W at a 10 deg coolant-ambient Tdelta.  Worst case scenario (to continuously dissipate 45 W if h is a worst-case 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>K at a 10 deg delta would require 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> (h is typically between 5 and 25 for free-air convection) ).
    * During in-air operation, coolant or radiator temperature should be monitored, and if necessary, fans may need to be used temporarily.
  * Low FPI (7 fpi) to maximize air flow (avoid trapping air that'll heat up).
  * Full copper jacket design.
  * Mounted next to sacrificial anode(s).


## Reservoir ##
_Aquacomputer G1/4 Aquatube_

  * **Mass** - 0.5 kg
  * **Dimensions** - Diameter: 79mm Length: 70 mm
  * **Fluid Capacity** - 160 mL
  * **Material**  - Delrin/Acrylic
  * Much easier to monitor fluid level and replenish coolant.
  * Added fluid increases coolant system's heat capacity/buffer.
  * Mounted externally, horizontally next to radiator with fill-port on top.

## Cooling Block ##
_Custom Thermoelectric Waterblock_

</img>

  * **Mass** - 155 g
  * **Dimensions** - Diameter: 41 mm x 41 mm x 14 mm
  * **Material** - All Copper
  * Will be mounted to aluminum/copper heat spreader.
