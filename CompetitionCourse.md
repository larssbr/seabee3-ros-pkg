# Competition Course #

I haven't completed the SolidWorks models of every task in the course, so I will upload them as I finish. I've started compiling a list of materials needed to build each task, and I'm still working on coming up with ideas for easy assembly/storage of the bigger tasks. Also, instead of making every PVC pipe task completely hollow, I thought it would be easier to just attach some foam to the inside to make it somewhat buoyant then attach the piece to weights on the bottom with string.

I'm going to upload the pictures sometime this week - I didn't have time this weekend. Sorry the page looks lame...

**Working on right now:**
  * Frame for window task
  * Frame for driving board
  * Counterweight/design of lever on driving board
  * Frame for parking task (legs to hold it up from the ground instead of floating)
  * Stand for sonar pinger


## Gate ##

There is no explanation or diagram of the gate in this year's competition book, so I modeled it from last year. In previous years there have been colored duct tape on each side of the gate as well. So I can add that if you think it will be included again this year.

**Materials:**
  * (2) 3in. dia. PVC endcaps
  * (2) 90-degree 3in. PVC elbows
  * (20 ft.) 3-in dia. black PVC pipe (or white PVC with black duct tape)

## Traffic Lights ##

I need help with these! Very confused on how they are going to put the LEDs underwater. Is it in a case? Or are the LEDs on the outside of each buoy?

## Parking ##

I'm thinking that for these parking pieces, we should put some foam inside of the PVC pipes to make them buoyant. Then attach the entire piece to weights using string. It will be easier than attaching endcaps to each part to make each buoyant on its own. It will also help in conserving weight needed to pull it down because we can adjust the amount of foam inside the pipes. Also, in the prelim rules it states that one end will be another RGB LED, but for now I think we can just make two neon green pieces that are detachable and adjust them later as needed.

**Materials:**
  * (10 ft.) 2in. dia. PVC pipe
  * Neon green duct tape
  * Nylon string
  * Foam (packing strips/styrofoam/anything buoyant)

## Bins ##

The competition calls for 4 bins. I can make 4, but if we only need like 1 or 2, let me know. Also, instead of making the bins a solid piece of PVC, because that would require extra sheets of PVC, I'm planning to simply suspend the cutout piece of the bin using PVC pipe. So, it won't be closed, but it will save _a lot_ of material.

**Materials (per bin):**
  * (8 ft.) 1/2in. dia. PVC pipe
  * 2 ft. x 3 ft. PVC sheet
  * Black duct tape

## Path ##

I'm assuming we will only want 1 or 2 path segments to practice recognition, but if we want more we will just need to buy more PVC sheets.

**Materials (per path segment):**
  * 4 ft. x 6in. PVC sheet
  * (6 ft.) 1/2in. dia. PVC pipe
  * "Blaze" Orange duct tape


## Toll Booth (Shooting) ##

They have no specifications up at all about the shooter boards/shapes/sizes...so I'm not sure if I should do anything yet. I could make a single PVC sheet with a random window in it, just so we could practice, but I'm not sure how helpful that would be.

## Wheel/Lever Manipulation ##

I was thinking of making the wheel spin by putting it on a rod similar to that of a skateboard truck then attaching it to the board with the lever. The PVC wheel would be attached to ball bearings that could go on a steel rod to spin underwater. **I'm not sure if this would work, so if there are any other ideas let me know!** I think when you see the CAD, it will make a little more sense, so I'm trying to finish all the tedious parts of the model right now. Almost done.

**Materials for wheel:**
  * (2) 0.25in. bearings (6455K2)
  * (2) 0.25in. lock nuts (97135A210)
  * (1) steel rod (8920K115)
  * (1) 4-way PVC connector for 1 in. dia.
  * (1.5 ft) 1 in. dia. PVC pipe/rod
  * (3 ft) 1.5 in. dia. PVC pipe

**Materials for board:**
  * 4 ft. x 4 ft. PVC sheet

## Drive-Thru (Sonar) ##

In order to make the sonar areas easier to move, I figured we could cut the large octagon then make foam shapes that attach to the PVC pipe once we get to the pool. The foam pieces would help to keep the entire piece floating, while also keeping together the parts. It wouldn't need to be too strong since the robot theoretically needs to surface completely within the shape, so if it does hit it, we can just rebuild it.

**Materials:**
  * (30 ft.) any diameter PVC pipe
