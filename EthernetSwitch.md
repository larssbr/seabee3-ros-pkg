# Introduction #

We plan on using two computers and networking them together. This requires an ethernet switch for communication. The switch has the advantage of allowing the robot's operator to connect a laptop to the robot directly, without the use of an external router.

# Selection #

Currently looking at the [Diamond Systems Epsilon](http://www.diamondsystems.com/products/epsilon) embedded ethernet switch. The switch has a compact form factor in that it is implemented as a single pcb with no case. However, the switch supports 8 ports where we only need 3, and thus might not be the best choice. Size and power consumption could be reduced with a better switch selection.

# To Do #

  * Make final decision on switch model
  * Figure out cabling and power requirements
