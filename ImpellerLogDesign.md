# Introduction #

With the goal of finding a cheaper solution to measuring the sub's velocity than using a Doppler Velocity Log, the most viable option is using an impeller log (a paddle wheel) to accomplish this.

# Details #
Impeller log uses a small propeller in the water and measures the rotation rate of the propeller, which is proportional to the speed of the vessel. Modern impeller logs does this electronically.

Pros: Cheaper, simpler, draws little power

Cons: Not as accurate as a DVL, only can measure velocity in one direction

Possible Devices: (Devices I have researched have commercial use)
