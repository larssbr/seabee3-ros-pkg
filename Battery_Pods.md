# Introduction #

Our Seabee AUVs have all had batteries on the inside of the hull that were both complicated to access, and thus hard to charge. It also caused a lot unnecessary opening of the hull and wasted time. Therefore, we are moving to an external battery pod system that will free up space in the new hull and make charging and accessing the batteries easier and safer.

# Components #

PRV - Pressure Relief Valve - We will be ordering [these](http://www.deepsea.com/prv2.php) most likely out of aluminum. They work like the name suggests; if the pod builds up too much pressure (like from a battery malfunction) the valve will burst and keep the pod from turning into essentially a pipe bomb.


# Initial Designs #

Like most if not all other teams using battery pods, our initial design is to use cylinders. The design models are as follows.

**Design 1:**

Aluminum pod with battery held on place by two 'rings' with square cutouts in the middle. The two holes are for the connector and the pressure relief valve.

**Design 2:**

We decided first of all to remodel the battery, as it is not a perfect square or even rectangle. So it now looks like this.

Then the rings idea for the battery pods was thrown out and instead we decided to including a hemispherical base in the tube that the battery could rest on. The endcaps and pod are all made out of aluminum.

**Design 3:**

While most of design 2 seemed alright, the way to connect the endcaps isn't ideal because it's hard to machine, and also just not as nice as it could be. So a third design was made after viewing the way a few other teams handle sealing round tubes.

As can be seen, this design uses aluminum endcaps but an acrylic pod. Also, one end is completely sealed (epoxy or some other waterproof adhesive will be used). The other end contains two parts connected by a latch. One part is completely fixed to the tube like the first cap, while the other will attach with o-rings and then be fixed by the latch. The latch allows us easy access to the battery.

# Redesign (from scratch sorta) #

**Design 4:**

After the mechanical meeting today (2/17/13), we realized something. The battery is square, so why is the tube (and everyone else's tube) round? The answer most likely is that it's easier to waterproof circles because o-rings are well rings, not squares. However, thanks to some digging (and an idea from [team Sweden's](http://www.projectvasa.com/media/) camera tubes we're going to scrap the whole thing and make it a square. Because doesn't putting a square peg in a square hole make more sense?

With this design it becomes very simple to access the battery and easy to seal it as well. The o-ring goes along a channel in the aluminum block and the top is sealed by screws. The battery is also able to rest in the block and if needed a screw can be added into the interior of the block to keep the battery from sliding around. However the channel is sized so this shouldn't really be an issue.

This design also becomes easy to mount to the frame as the threaded holes go all the way through.

Cons:
There are two cons to this design compared to the first set of designs. However the benefits outweigh the cons in my opinion.
1. Potential for battery pods to be used for flotation, or at least be able to neutralize themselves is gone as the air space in the tube is a lot less.
2. It costs more, but the difference in price is less than $150 per pod(based on initial cost estimates)
