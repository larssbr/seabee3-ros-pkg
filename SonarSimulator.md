# Introduction #

Stub page for work on MATLAB sonar algorithm and DSP simulator.

## Getting the code ##

The sonar simulator is now hosted on google code, under the sonar\_simulator branch of the software repository. After you checkout the sofware repo as per https://code.google.com/p/seabee3-ros-pkg/source/checkout, cd to the seabee3-ros-pkg directory, then run:

```
git checkout sonar_simulator
```

This will switch to the sonar\_simulator branch, allowing you to work on the code.

## To-do List ##
  * GUI
  * Quantize signal as a function of bit depth

## Multilateration Algorithm ##
