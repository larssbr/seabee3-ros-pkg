# Introduction #

In order to mount all of our electronics inside of the hull, we utilized a custom designed internal frame attached to our end cap, which can slide in and out of the hull on Teflon rails. This frame is machined from aluminum and is designed around our electronics, ensuring a secure mounting platform for every device that is installed in the SeaBee III. We used CAD software to model all of the electronic components and ensure that they would both fit into the hull when it was completed. We aimed to maximize and efficiently use space within the hull.
