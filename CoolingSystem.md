# Introduction #

Because of SeaBee IIIâ€™s dual core processor and a number of other highly thermally demanding elements, it is necessary to provide a cooling system to prevent damage to the electronics. To that end, we designed a unique water-cooling system consisting of two cooling blocks, an external radiator and a circulation pump. The primary cooling block is mounted to the standard XTX heat-spreader to cool our CPU while the second smaller cooling block pulls heat away from the motor- driver H-bridges. The radiator is designed to be both light and effective, consisting of a series of copper pipes attached securely to the end cap and extending just between the hull and the external frame.
