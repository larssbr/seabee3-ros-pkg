# Introduction #

The marker dropper mechanism was constructed using linear actuators. This design features a compact frame and a robust releasing structure that is quick, accurate, and reliable. The dropper is connected to the SeaBee III internal electronics using a 4-pin connector on the end cap. When the control signals activate the relays, the two solenoids on the marker dropper release a marker which is held in place with two spring-loaded arms. The markers are shaped like mini-torpedoes with angled fin tails to induce a spin during the descent. This shape ensures a highly hydrodynamic marker that will fall in a more streamlined way than that of a spherical marker.
