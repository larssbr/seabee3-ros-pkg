## Laser ##

_The exact laser is still being decided upon, but here are the current choices_

**Laser Sights**

used on guns so they're better than a normal laser pointer and can stay on longer, but they're battery powered and controlled using a remote (could probably find a way to make it computer controlled, the battery may be an issue though)

**Lab Laser**

This is the cheapest one I could find and looks small enough to fit, can't find any info on its exact size specs though.

this one seems ideal if we can find it, its a cylindrical one that can be modulated externally and is pretty small (30mm diameter). Haven't been able to find one for sale anywhere
